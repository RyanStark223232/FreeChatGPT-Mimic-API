<h1> FreeChatGPT-Mimic-API </h1>

Welcome to this exciting python flask app! With this app, you can easily transform the free ChatGPT trial page into an API that will revolutionize the way you work.

API allows you to seamlessly integrate ChatGPT into any simple script, giving you the power to perform tasks such as writing resumes, classifying local directories, and simple Q&A.
Especially for people living in places where ChatGPT is now accessible and have a hard time paying for the service. 

To ensure that our app is used ethically, we have intentionally omitted the feature of automatic login, preventing individuals from making mass requests. 
Hope you all value the importance of responsible usage and allow everyone to make their life slightly easier with this simple hack.

<h2> Setup </h2>
